If the charger works in the state of lithium battery and charges a NI-MH battery or nickel-cadmium battery, the battery will be charged insufficiently and the working time will be greatly reduced.
                                If the charger works in the state of nickel battery to charge lithium battery, the lithium battery will be overcharged. It will seriously affect the battery cycle life.</li>

                    <strong>18650 battery in series:</strong> When multiple 18650 lithium batteries are connected in series, the battery pack voltage is the total of all battery voltage, but the capacity remains unchanged.

                    <strong>18650 battery in parallel:</strong> If you connect multiple 18650 lithium batteries in parallel, you can get more power. The parallel connection of lithium battery keeps the voltage constant, while the capacity increases. The total capacity is the sum of the total capacity of all single lithium batteries.
